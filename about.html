The name of the organization shall be the University of Cincinnati Video Game Graphics Group (VG3). The advisor for this organization is Ben Britton.<br/> <br/>   <center>
   The organization was founded in 2004 by students and faculty in the Electronic Arts Program in the School of Art in the College of Design, Architecture, Art & Planning. The aim of our organization is to educate the members of the group regarding the videogame industry and workshops are presented to prepare them for jobs in the industry in the future. Our purpose is to provide a place where the members can educate and inspire each other in the honing of their individual crafts through the sharing of work and ideas at meetings and online gatherings.  Our goal is to help members in pursuit of employment within the video game industry upon graduation from UC.
